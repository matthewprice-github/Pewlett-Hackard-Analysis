# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview 
The purpose of this analysis is to help identify the number of retiring employees this year from Pewlett Hackard's vast employee database, as well as identify other employees that are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Using PostgreSQL, we are able to create queries that can select all of the upcoming retirees from the database quickly and efficiently. Judging from the results, there appears to be a "silver tsunami" of employees planning to retire. 
## Results 
The Results of the Pewlett Hackard analysis are as follows: 
* At a high level, 90K+ employees at Pewlett Hackard are ready to retire this year. We can see the count of retirees by title [here](https://github.com/matthewprice-github/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Data/retirement_titles.csv). 
* 29.4K (or 33%) of the retirees are senior engineers, which is the most common title of the outgoing employees, followed closely by 28.3K (or 31%) Senior Staff, and 14.2K (or 16%) Engineers. 
* The title least affected by the next wave of retirees are managers, where only 2 are planning to retire this year. 
* Looking at the [membership eligablity list](https://github.com/matthewprice-github/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Data/mentorship_eligibility.csv), there appear to be only ~1.5K employees that are eligable for the membership program
